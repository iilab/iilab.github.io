As part of the No-Disconnect strategy, DG Connect has commissioned a feasibility study on a ‘European
Capability for Situational Awareness’ (ECSA). The objective is to help EU decision-makers to obtain highquality and trustworthy information and also gather early-warning capabilities necessary to better
perform their functions, particularly in cases which may require EU integrated and multi-level
intervention.

The consortium has produced recommendations for the sector and the EC.

## Pillars of European Capability

> Recommendation Set #1: Sustaining Ongoing Situational Awareness Initiatives in Europe

We recommend that ongoing European projects, potential pillars of the Internet and Human Rights field and necessary components of a European Situational Awareness, be urgently supported in order to allow Europe to establish its position as a leading global force in the race against the increasing online restrictions and attacks that undermine human rights.

* Internet censorship monitoring: Ooni (Tor Project) (US, Berlin + Rome offices), The ChokePoint Project (NL), Alkasir (SE), Open Rights Group (UK)
* Internet surveillance monitoring: Privacy International (UK)
* Internet attacks monitoring: Radically Open Security (NL)
* On-the-ground human rights monitoring: Intermediary organisations such as Amnesty International (UK), Small Media (Iran-UK), Frontline Defenders (IE), Hivos (NL), IWPR (UK), Tactical Technology Collective (DE), Bytes 4 All (Pak.), Skeyes Foundation (Leb.), Institute For Development of Freedom of Information (Georgia) to name a few.
* On-the-ground media monitoring: Local civil society partners & intermediary organisations6 such as Reporter without Borders (FR), Free Press Unlimited (NL), Internews (EU), Index on Censorship (UK), Bureau of Investigative Journalism (UK), Media Legal Defense Initiative (UK)
* Methodologies: Oxford Internet Inst. (UK), CIHR (DE), European University Institute (IT), Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights (IT)
* Circumvention: Alkasir (SE), Your Freedom (DE)
* Secure hosting: Virtual Roads (Qurium UK), Greenhost (NL)
* Digital Security: Tactical Technology Collective (DE), Frontline Defenders (IR), Globaleaks (IT), Cyber Arabs – IWPR (UK)
* Policy/Legal: GIPO (SP), Global Partners (UK), Tilburg University (NL), La Quadrature du Net (FR)

We recommend to implement these recommendations using existing funding mechanisms in the Human Rights and
Democracy domain inside the EU (EiDHR – Democracy Action Plan – Neighborhood Policy Instrument – Instrument for Pre-Accession IPA) to issue specific calls on a regular basis designated to benefit all organisations in the Internet Censorship Domain and the Internet and Human Rights domain more broadly, as discussed by the study.

## Sectors of European Capability

> Recommendation Set #2 Supporting the Sectors Participating in European Situational Awareness

<br>

There are also significant capacity and funding gaps within each of the stakeholder sectors that can
support the main functions (monitoring, analysis and support mitigation) of the Internet and Human Rights sector's Situational Awareness.

Within the EU, it is the role of the EEAS to promote and defend human rights internationally, DGCONNECT
has the expertise in ICT and its role is to ensure the integrity of the global internet, DGDEVCO
is the main ERU stakeholder in support to local civil society and Democracy and Human Rights
development, DG HOME/JUSTICE is responsible for the defence of European citizens' rights, DG
RESEARCH for the support to interdisciplinary research on Internet and Human Rights.

* Academia:

Support interdisciplinary research, fellowships and conferences to establish the scientific and methodological foundations of the space and enable evidence backed
policy making.

Initiate international academic partnerships. Initiate more collaborations with local organisations and
international NGOs.

DG JRC / DG RTD:
Support interdisciplinary research, fellowships and
conferences to establish the scientific and
methodological foundations of the space and enable
evidence backed policy making.
Mitigate for the important gaps in global coverage
related to data collection and analysis resulting
from gaps in funding.
Local Organisations:
Support stakeholders working in countries and regions
where human rights online are at risk, support the
development of capacity of local organisations to take part
in the monitoring, analysis and mitigation of incidents.
DG EEAS / DG DEVCO:
Improve the safety of communications with local
civil society providing information about the
situation on the ground.
HOME/JUSTICE (defend organisations against
internet restrictions and attacks in Europe).
Technical Professional Communities: (including
computer security, network measurement, software
engineering, etc)
Enable more collaboration with other sectors.
Establish a Civil Society CERT7
.
Publish more open data usable by civil society about
infrastructures (including on mobile apps and social
networking sites).
DG CONNECT / EEAS:
Strengthen the connection between the technical
professional communities and the human rights
dimension.
Support innovation, piloting and deployment of
measurement and mitigation tools and
infrastructure playing a role in identifying and
supporting mitigation of human rights violations.
International NGOs:
Develop capacity and collaborations on analysis of
incidents and develop technical capacity to design and
implement data driven initiatives.
Collaborate more with academia on methodologies.
DG DEVCO / DG CONNECT:
Facilitate the interoperability of existing monitoring
platforms with the Internet and Human Rights
sector efforts.
ICT Industry Sector:
Collaborate on Human Rights impact assessments.
Support partnerships around research.
Enable partnerships around responsible disclosure about
civil society targeting.
DG TRADE / DG CONNECT:
Support the identification and control of sales of
surveillance and attack technology.
