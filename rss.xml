    <title>Supporting decisions in a complex world</title>
    <link>https://iilab.org/news/2015-01-30-decisions-complex-world.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>As Adam Bly identified in 2012 at Ars Electronica: The Big Picture, complexity is the challenge of our time and what we need is an image that captures it. We think it is critical to develop the tools that will help reduce this complexity to its essentials, and make it easier to understand and more accessible. That way, we can face some of our time’s difficult challenges armed with the best information we can get.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>At the edge of the scientific inquiry into how policy decisions are made, iilab’s Head of Research and Design, Kat Austen, as part of her consultancy work, is involved in reviewing the European Commission’s DG Connect GSS Cluster projects. She recently <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/report-meeting-projects-funded-global-systems-science-gss">reported on a meeting of projects funded in Global Systems Science (GSS) that look at evidence-based policy making</a>. It prompted us to think about how understanding and visualising - in the broadest sense of the word - complex systems can help in supporting vital decisions from the individual to the international level.</p>
<h2 id="revealing-complex-networks">Revealing Complex Networks</h2>
<p>One of the most important challenges facing our times is climate change, and one of the reasons it’s so challenging is because it requires us to have an understanding of our influence within a complex network that is bigger in both space and time than our human experience. Nevertheless, combatting it requires decision-making on every level. GSS’s INSITE project looks at the “importance of narrative to society and individuals both in its emergence and its effect” and questions the assumptions behind our models and how much norms influence our ways of thinking about problems. These considerations inform our community based approaches for <a href="https://iilab.org/projects/open-droplet.html">Open Droplet</a>, our open source, open hardware water measurement sensor that will be networked, easy to use and allows people and communities to steward their water use.</p>
<p>In our research and design, we are paying particular attention to cultural attitudes towards water and how it affects consumption of resources. We’ll post here later the results of a 5 city overview undertaken for iilab by UCL Masters students which includes cultural analysis in addition infrastructure and technology analysis. When it comes to stewardship of natural resources, evolving cultural attitudes goes beyond current techniques to prompt behavior change, such as neighbor competition or financial incentives, and is something that we are researching to shape the data interfaces we’re developing for Open Droplet - what ways might there be of hinting at our influence in complex networks, without having to show them explicitly?</p>
<p>Sometimes, you do want to see these networks explicitly. We have also recently joined the <a href="https://influencemapping.org/">Influence Mapping</a> group, which looks at data-driven social network analysis projects to understand influence relationships between people and organisations. It will also map out the network of policy-makers involved in international trade negotiations around the regulation of intellectual property.</p>
<h2 id="gathering-evidence-from-open-sources">Gathering evidence from open sources</h2>
<p>But how do we find out about these networks? Beyond the work that aims to collect evidence about domestic water consumption with Open Droplet, iilab participates in projects where technology is used to improve the collection, analysis and presentation of evidence in ways that involve the public and informs policy making, such as the <a href="/project/open-integrity.html">Open Integrity Index</a>, ECSA (also with DG Connect), the <a href="/project/open-oil.html">Open Oil corporate navigator</a>.</p>
<p>The text mining and semantic analysis tools developed by the GSS Cluster - for instance the tools used in GLODERS for analysing open source court and police documents - are relevant to our work in facilitating the sourcing of structured evidence by scraping open source documents. When we participated in the Open Oil hackathon in Berlin in January, we explored a number of methods by which to extract this information. For instance, ContentMine has developed new technology which can be used to extract diagrams from PDFs and might be of use to mine information about company organograms. Also Open Oil is now partnering with CrowdCrafting to <a href="http://crowdcrafting.org/app/openoil/">crowdsource the analysis of contracts from the oil industry</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/no-disconnect-strategy-workshop-european-capability-situational">ECSA project</a> we also look at how “to augment EU decision-making capabilities with reliable and real-time or almost real-time information concerning human rights violations and/or restrictions of fundamental freedoms in connection with the digital environment.” As part of the study we are looking at the feasibility of collecting and analysing information from open sources including internet measurement infrastructure and publicly available reports about potential human rights violation incidents.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-trust-the-evidence">How to trust the evidence?</h2>
<p>As we’re all aware, not all information online is trustworthy, and as a society we are always navigating who to listen to and what to believe in an era of information overload. The EU Community project aims to address trust and reliability by assigning authority to people and documents. Open Integrity Index, on the other hand, looks into trustworthiness by collecting evidence from the crowd and experts about the practices adopted by tool developers with regards to security and privacy. When submitting evidence it must be accompanied by a link which makes it verifiable by anyone. While there are still challenges around assigning authority to people, particularly when dealing with complex and multi-faceted issues like digital security and privacy, this transparency and breaking down problems into smaller parts help focus the debate and make the analysis more robust and legible.</p>
<p>We used this same approach with the <a href="http://newsverify.atchai.com/">News Verify project</a>, in collaboration with Atchai, where we developed a news publishing platform with a verification framework. NewsVerify allows journalists to curate pieces of evidence from social media and the web, and tie them together as news with a verification status and narrative that can be seen by readers and updated as more evidence is added. Checkdesk from Meedan is further innovating in this domain by developing a liveblogging tool for journalists, with built-in tools to allow citizen journalists and staff journalists alike to make and verify reports. These novel approaches in journalism help open up the way to informed citizen participation in policy making.</p>
<h2 id="modelling-and-data-analysis">Modelling and Data Analysis</h2>
<p>The tools we need to build to address challenges in evidence based decision making should be sophisticated enough to capture the essential complexity of reality, but succeed in being in simple and accessible to their audience and users. Computer science has a lot of room for development to get rid of the non-essential complexity which plagues existing large software systems (cf <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/design/out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf">Out of the tar pit, B. Moseley &amp; P. Marks 2006</a>). In turn, there are exciting design challenges in making more simple to develop these sophisticated tools in more robust ways, as well as in creating simple, accessible, usable - and in some cases emotive - interfaces with data, and bridging the gap between the digital and corporeal worlds. This can only be the result of a multi-disciplinary effort that is firmly grounded in technological and social innovation.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Open and Human Centric technology - Presenting Panic Button at Labtogether</title>
    <link>https://iilab.org/news/2014-11-06-betterplace-labtogether.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Betterplace Lab invited iilab to present our work with <a href="http://amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> on the <a href="https://panicbutton.io">Panic Button app</a> at the <a href="http://www.betterplace-lab.org/labtogether">Lab Together 2014</a>.</p>
<p>The main focus of my presentation was the role of the <strong>Open and Human Centered process</strong> that pervaded the project since it started in 2011.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Betterplace Lab is a research lab exploring digital innovations to help people, organizations and companies working in the social sector. At the Lab Together this year, they held a discussion on digital privacy with our friends <a href="https://www.tacticaltech.org/">Tactical Technology Collective</a> and the new Data and Politics project lead Fieke Jansen, panels on Crowdfinancing and Productive failure, and presentations on digital relief trends.</p>

</div>
<p>Panic Button didn’t come fully formed out of the <a href="https://openideo.com/challenge/amnesty/realisation/">Open Ideo open innovation process</a>, that it took a lot of iterations in prototyping and later in implementation to get to <a href="https://panicbutton.io">where the application is today</a>.</p>
<p>Also, Open Source is an useful approach to improve the sustainability of a social impact project. It allowed iilab to pick up where Toughtworks had left, and will allow other developers to get onboard in the future. A question from the audience correctly pointed out that there are other factors to be able to support the <a href="http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/howtobuildcommunity">emergence of an open source community around a project</a> and Panic Button is still in an incubation phase with a few <a href="https://github.com/iilab/PanicButton/graphs/contributors">contributors</a> including paid ones.</p>
<p>Crucially we used an <a href="https://github.com/iilab/PanicButton-Design">Open Design approach</a> which included the use of <a href="https://github.com/iilab/PanicButton-Design/tree/master/Archive/5_Prototype_v2/Prototype%20v2%20Paper%20wireframes">paper based prototypes</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/iilab/PanicButton-Design/tree/master/Usability%20Testing">structured method to collect the results</a> of user testing. We gathered security experts, also with a human centric and <a href="https://tacticaltech.org/holistic-security">holistic security</a> approach to evaluate risks and feed into the <a href="https://github.com/iilab/PanicButton/blob/master/docs/SECURITY.md">security design and documentation</a> of Panic Button.</p>
<p>I wish there would have been more time for interaction with the audience, but the feedback on twitter was good so I hope the presentation provided some food for thought.</p>

    <title>How to make a non-evil IoT - Open Droplet at LOTE4</title>
    <link>https://iilab.org/news/2014-11-02-open-droplet-lote4.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Last week we had the opportunity to take Open Droplet to LOTE4: The Stewardship. Open Droplet was one of the five projects looking at physical assets, and the only one that involved Internet of Things. IoT got a pretty bad vibe going from the get-go because of the associated scary privacy and control problems. (Alberto gave me a steer to <a href="http://kryakk-catalogue.prokhorovfund.ru/the-epic-struggle-for-the-internet-of-things/">Bruce Sterling’s “The Epic Struggle for the Internet of Things”</a> , which goes a good way to explaining the issues).</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For session notes, see the Open Droplet session here: <a href="https://lote4.hackpad.com/Stewarding-Physical-Assets-EVxm8c6PyiU"></a>https://lote4.hackpad.com/Stewarding-Physical-Assets-EVxm8c6PyiU</p>
<p>The session was interesting. We had an involved discussion about other aspects of the project, from the sensor design and usability, to how best to convey information to the user.</p>
<p>Some useful new suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>partner with hotels to raise awareness of this approach</li>
<li>consider representing the total household use</li>
</ul>
<p>There was reiteration of the importance of these considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>open data and privacy</li>
<li>comparison as a motivator</li>
<li>proper use by understanding the water infrastructure</li>
<li>facilitating conversation around community stewardship of water, including water harvesting</li>
</ul>
<p>However, we didn’t have that much time to discuss the IoT issues, which would have been great to explore with the EdgeRyders community. Internet of Things is happening, and could be very useful in terms of facilitating stewardship of physical assets. What we’re aiming for with Open Droplet is to create a device and system that helps connect people with water, an increasingly stressed resource, so that we can take better care of it as individuals and communities - and find new ways to do so. Part of how we want to do that is by following the principles of an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yZAsNaesDocqqtkFgucbFS_zE4tDP1Jsfszsvls7Yuc/edit">Open Internet of Things</a>.</p>
<p>I would love to extend the dialogue around these issues, and to have explored more the role of Internet of Things in creating social change, and looking at how sensing technologies can be tools to generate social and paradigmatic change. Due to timing issues the unconference session “<a href="https://lote4.hackpad.com/How-do-we-create-a-non-evil-IoT-X5pTvtOF8ma">How to make a non-evil IoT</a>” didn’t happen. We were going to look at building on work to make Open Hardware solutions that explicitly avoid making Big Data for the sake of it. How do you quantify without compromising people? I’d like to continue that discussion here and on the EdgeRyders platform, looking at these and other questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanding IoT - What data do we need to have from city and infrastructure providers to give useful context to individual water use?<br /></li>
<li>How do we responsibly approach the individual’s rights to their data</li>
<li>How do requirements for water stewardship vary around the globe? How do we accommodate these differences?</li>
<li>How do we facilitate community water stewardship through interface and sensor design?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="first-meeting-with-the-ucl-students">First meeting with the UCL Students</h2>
<p>Last month I had the pleasure to meet up in person with the students from Sarah Bell’s MSc Environmental Systems Engineering at UCL. Our team consists of Florian Abiteboul, Shanshan Tang, Cecilia Li, and Shibei Cheng and Anita Ponnathpore and it was a great first meeting. Having introduced the project, I’ve asked them to start off with the background research for a protocol to rapidly categorise cities in terms of their water infrastructure in order to see where Open Droplet’s approach might be most effective. When we meet this month, we’ll be handing over plans from the industrial research so that the students can then test calibration and flow detection in UCL’s toilets and showers.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Open Droplet features on Serpentine Gallery's extinct.ly platform</title>
    <link>https://iilab.org/news/2014-10-18-open-droplet-serpentine-extinctly.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>“the spectre of extinction looms over the ways in which we understand our being in the world today.”</p>
<p>At London’s Serpentine Gallery this weekend thinkers, scientists and artists are coming together to focus on this ever present spectre at the <a href="http://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/extinction-marathon">Extinction Marathon</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Understanding that it is only through collective action that we might avoid a disaster on a global scale, the gallery has commissioned <a href="http://extinct.ly">extinct.ly</a>, an online platform to act as a resource for researchers and those who wish to effect change.</p>
<p>We are honoured that Open Droplet has been picked to appear alongside other excellent projects such as <a href="http://hack4good.io/">hack4good</a> and our project partner <a href="https://iilab.org/projects/open-oil-framework.html">Open Oil</a> as the first projects to feature in extinct.ly’s launch.</p>
<p>On <a href="http://www.extinct.ly/casestudies/#open-droplet">Open Droplet’s page on extinct.ly</a> you can experience the near-future scenario that we have crafted around water scarcity.</p>

<p>Technical info: For this test we’re using low grade silicon (<a href="http://www.silikonfabrik.de/product_info.php?info=p134_HANSA-Silikon-HS620---0-9-kg.html">HS620 Silikon</a> + catalyst) with a blue pigment, and we measured proportions by weight. We coated the moulds with a wax separator (<a href="http://www.silikonfabrik.de/product_info.php?info=p14_Trennspray--500ml.html">Trennmittel</a>) so the silicon didn’t stick.</p>
<p>Next steps: * Modifying the gain of the microphone preamp to compensate for the silicon’s attenuation. * Including very low consumption LEDs on the PCB. * Add wax to make it easier to remove the silicon casing without damaging the sensor. * Test with higher grade silicon. * <a href="https://droplet.hackpad.com/Open-Droplet-Form-Design-km42HJk4XU1">Design the casing shape</a> for CNC milling of the mould. * Look into wireless charging. * Measure the heat generated by the power system.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Partnership and proof of concept</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>We’re happy to reveal a couple of marvellous videos for you.</p>
<p>iilab is partnering on Open Droplet with <a href="http://www.resurgence.io/">Resurgence</a>, an organisation based in London’s <a href="http://theodi.org/">Open Data Institute (ODI)</a> and focussing on creating smart, disaster resilient cities. We are hoping to work together to leverage the Internet of Things to make water measurement more open, collaborative and affordable.</p>

<p>Off the back of some of our <a href="https://iilab.org/news/2014-09-10-water-water-everywhere.html">preliminary research</a>, one key component of what we are planning to do with Open Droplet is to provide context to the data collected by individual sensors. This will involve a two-way flow of data between individuals, and utilities and public bodies who are responsible for the water infrastructure. This turns Open Droplet into more than just a water sensor - it’s a means of understanding how individual water flows fit within the overall water infrastructure.</p>
<p>We’ve put together a video to present the overall vision of the project in terms of environment and resilience. Here it is, with thanks to Mark Harvey from Resurgence, Open Videographer wizard <a href="http://www.cameralibre.cc/">Sam Muirhead</a>, and Alex Shure, Jun Matsushita and (ahem, the very camera shy) yours truly from the Open Droplet team.</p>

<p>We’d also like to show off the progress we’ve made on Open Droplet hardware development. Alex has created this great video of his work, showing how he’s now got the microphone registering low frequency noise (which should correspond to shower noise) and measuring that noise for as long is it detects it. Here’s a demonstration of the proof of concept for the Open Droplet design.</p>
