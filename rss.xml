    <title>Supporting decisions in a complex world</title>
    <link>https://iilab.org/news/2015-01-30-decisions-complex-world.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>As Adam Bly identified in 2012 at Ars Electronica: The Big Picture, complexity is the challenge of our time and what we need is an image that captures it. We think it is critical to develop the tools that will help reduce this complexity to its essentials, and make it easier to understand and more accessible. That way, we can face some of our time’s difficult challenges armed with the best information we can get.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>At the edge of the scientific inquiry into how policy decisions are made, iilab’s Head of Research and Design, Kat Austen, as part of her consultancy work, is involved in reviewing the European Commission’s DG Connect GSS Cluster projects. She recently <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/report-meeting-projects-funded-global-systems-science-gss">reported on a meeting of projects funded in Global Systems Science (GSS) that look at evidence-based policy making</a>. It prompted us to think about how understanding and visualising - in the broadest sense of the word - complex systems can help in supporting vital decisions from the individual to the international level.</p>
<h2 id="revealing-complex-networks">Revealing Complex Networks</h2>
<p>One of the most important challenges facing our times is climate change, and one of the reasons it’s so challenging is because it requires us to have an understanding of our influence within a complex network that is bigger in both space and time than our human experience. Nevertheless, combatting it requires decision-making on every level. GSS’s INSITE project looks at the “importance of narrative to society and individuals both in its emergence and its effect” and questions the assumptions behind our models and how much norms influence our ways of thinking about problems. These considerations inform our community based approaches for <a href="https://iilab.org/projects/open-droplet.html">Open Droplet</a>, our open source, open hardware water measurement sensor that will be networked, easy to use and allows people and communities to steward their water use.</p>
<p>In our research and design, we are paying particular attention to cultural attitudes towards water and how it affects consumption of resources. We’ll post here later the results of a 5 city overview undertaken for iilab by UCL Masters students which includes cultural analysis in addition infrastructure and technology analysis. When it comes to stewardship of natural resources, evolving cultural attitudes goes beyond current techniques to prompt behavior change, such as neighbor competition or financial incentives, and is something that we are researching to shape the data interfaces we’re developing for Open Droplet - what ways might there be of hinting at our influence in complex networks, without having to show them explicitly?</p>
<p>Sometimes, you do want to see these networks explicitly. We have also recently joined the <a href="https://influencemapping.org/">Influence Mapping</a> group, which looks at data-driven social network analysis projects to understand influence relationships between people and organisations. It will also map out the network of policy-makers involved in international trade negotiations around the regulation of intellectual property.</p>
<h2 id="gathering-evidence-from-open-sources">Gathering evidence from open sources</h2>
<p>But how do we find out about these networks? Beyond the work that aims to collect evidence about domestic water consumption with Open Droplet, iilab participates in projects where technology is used to improve the collection, analysis and presentation of evidence in ways that involve the public and informs policy making, such as the <a href="/project/open-integrity.html">Open Integrity Index</a>, ECSA (also with DG Connect), the <a href="/project/open-oil.html">Open Oil corporate navigator</a>.</p>
<p>The text mining and semantic analysis tools developed by the GSS Cluster - for instance the tools used in GLODERS for analysing open source court and police documents - are relevant to our work in facilitating the sourcing of structured evidence by scraping open source documents. When we participated in the Open Oil hackathon in Berlin in January, we explored a number of methods by which to extract this information. For instance, ContentMine has developed new technology which can be used to extract diagrams from PDFs and might be of use to mine information about company organograms. Also Open Oil is now partnering with CrowdCrafting to <a href="http://crowdcrafting.org/app/openoil/">crowdsource the analysis of contracts from the oil industry</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/no-disconnect-strategy-workshop-european-capability-situational">ECSA project</a> we also look at how “to augment EU decision-making capabilities with reliable and real-time or almost real-time information concerning human rights violations and/or restrictions of fundamental freedoms in connection with the digital environment.” As part of the study we are looking at the feasibility of collecting and analysing information from open sources including internet measurement infrastructure and publicly available reports about potential human rights violation incidents.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-trust-the-evidence">How to trust the evidence?</h2>
<p>As we’re all aware, not all information online is trustworthy, and as a society we are always navigating who to listen to and what to believe in an era of information overload. The EU Community project aims to address trust and reliability by assigning authority to people and documents. Open Integrity Index, on the other hand, looks into trustworthiness by collecting evidence from the crowd and experts about the practices adopted by tool developers with regards to security and privacy. When submitting evidence it must be accompanied by a link which makes it verifiable by anyone. While there are still challenges around assigning authority to people, particularly when dealing with complex and multi-faceted issues like digital security and privacy, this transparency and breaking down problems into smaller parts help focus the debate and make the analysis more robust and legible.</p>
<p>We used this same approach with the <a href="http://newsverify.atchai.com/">News Verify project</a>, in collaboration with Atchai, where we developed a news publishing platform with a verification framework. NewsVerify allows journalists to curate pieces of evidence from social media and the web, and tie them together as news with a verification status and narrative that can be seen by readers and updated as more evidence is added. Checkdesk from Meedan is further innovating in this domain by developing a liveblogging tool for journalists, with built-in tools to allow citizen journalists and staff journalists alike to make and verify reports. These novel approaches in journalism help open up the way to informed citizen participation in policy making.</p>
<h2 id="modelling-and-data-analysis">Modelling and Data Analysis</h2>
<p>The tools we need to build to address challenges in evidence based decision making should be sophisticated enough to capture the essential complexity of reality, but succeed in being in simple and accessible to their audience and users. Computer science has a lot of room for development to get rid of the non-essential complexity which plagues existing large software systems (cf <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/design/out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf">Out of the tar pit, B. Moseley &amp; P. Marks 2006</a>). In turn, there are exciting design challenges in making more simple to develop these sophisticated tools in more robust ways, as well as in creating simple, accessible, usable - and in some cases emotive - interfaces with data, and bridging the gap between the digital and corporeal worlds. This can only be the result of a multi-disciplinary effort that is firmly grounded in technological and social innovation.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Nix + OSX + HaskellNG = Dependency Paradise ?</title>
    <link>https://iilab.org/news/2015-03-27-nix-osx-haskellng-hakyll.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve recently started to learn Haskell and have been in the books for a few months, so didn’t yet have to experience the practical side of what comes with the workflow of working with Haskell.</p>
<p>I decided to try getting my hands dirty with a simple project, migrating the iilab website to the Haskell static site generator <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>. In this post I look at how I setup my development environment, and hope to ease the pain for others that are used to the simple <code>npm install</code> style workflows by looking at the latest in how to deal with Haskell dependency problems also known as “cabal hell”.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Last year after a difficult experience with Jekyll for the Amnesty International Panic Button website, I looked around other approaches to do static website generation and, given I was into JS at the time and like the small modules approach, I settled on metalsmith, which seemed to have a clever design, based on a configurable pipeline, that seemed flexible enough. When I installed it, I did have to hack a few modules to make them do what I wanted, but it seemed straighforward enough. More recently I wanted to do a bit of freshening up on our website, and was looking at building a workflow with css/js concatenation and minimisation. Given how metalsmith was supposed to be this versatile, build pipeline, I thought it would be simple but I got turned off by the lack of clarity, and things started breaking pretty badly when I tried to upgrade modules to latest versions.</p>
<p>That’s when, in a familiar sequence of events, <a href="http://chriswarbo.net/blog/2014-07-14-nixos.html">well captured</a> as</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to do something simple</li>
<li>Fail</li>
<li>Go down a rabbit hole in an attempt to fix it</li>
</ul>
<p>I recursed through a few rabbit holes after my metalsmith/npm woes by trying Hakyll, running into cabal hell, decided to try Nix, saw that it was a bit bleeding edge for OSX, managed to go through that more or less, until I bumped into a compilation problem with the haskellPackages and was helped by the nice folks on the <code>##nix-darwin</code> IRC channel and pointed to the even more bleeding edge HaskellNG Nix approach which of course, is how deep the rabbit hole goes.</p>
<p>In short, here’s how the pieces fit together:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nix provides <strong>declarative</strong> and <strong>deterministic</strong> package management. Read about <a href="https://www.domenkozar.com/2014/03/11/why-puppet-chef-ansible-arent-good-enough-and-we-can-do-better/">why you should care</a>. <br><br></li>
<li><p>HaskellNG draws on Nix to make Haskell package management <strong>declarative</strong> and goes beyond the current <code>cabal sandbox</code> approach by allowing:</p>
<ul>
<li>reuse of already compiled binaries (instead of having to recompile separately in every sandbox) and</li>
<li>dealing with dependencies at the compiler (and cabal) level, therefore <a href="https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2015-March/118817.html">allowing to test bleeding edge compiler features</a> without fear of messing up your development environment.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nix">Nix</h2>
<p>Nix is a package manager which is also the foundation of a linux distribution called NixOS which uses the philosophy of Nix through and through to provide a well regarded linux distribution. What Nix offers is a reliable way to manage dependencies and escape the various type of hells that the problem creates (DLL hell, cabal hell, the type of spagetthi that systems folk don’t want…). It does this by knowing the complete dependency tree of all the packages it manages. This reminds me of docker’s declarative approach to system configuratio, except that I think that docker’s layered approach at the file system level brings an interesting lower level dimension. In any case, with Nix, several binaries with a different set of dependencies can coexist on your system, and more importantly, use the functional immutable approach to Nix package dependencies in order to keep your environment and yourself health, sane and functional.</p>
<p>A few things that Nix does is make sure dependencies are exact (by using binary hashes in a clever way - which includes all the dependency tree of the binary) and only reuse them when necessary. This means that the nix store holds a range of binary images which might be used by different other binaries and can coexist happily.</p>
<p>Nix then offers a number of wrapping tools to make these binaries available, for instance, when installing with <code>nix-env -iA nixpkgs.somePackage</code> you’re installing somePackage inside your <strong>user environment</strong> which is in fact symbolic links to the nix store defined in your <code>~/.nix-profile</code> directory.</p>
<p>When using <code>nix-shell</code> you’re using a <strong>project environment</strong> which might have different dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="nix-on-osx">Nix on OSX</h2>
<p>The great thing, given my current dependency on this fruity old laptop and its pretty UX, is that Nix is available on OSX. I took me a little bit of meandering to find out because there are <a href="http://www.chrisjr.org/posts/2014/12/22/nix-osx-haskell/">outdated blog posts</a> on the web (which give workarounds from <strong>before</strong> the OSX changes were marged into the Nix master branch) that <a href="https://nixos.org/wiki/Nix_on_OS_X#Using_Nix_on_10.9_and_10.10">these instructions on the NixOS Wiki about <strong>Using Nix on 10.9 and 10.10</strong></a> actually work just fine. I did bump into a problem because I started installing from the wrong git repo, a number of weird errors came up after switching to the correct instructions which meant that I had to restart from scratch and remove all the nix directories (/nix/store and ˜/.nix-profile).</p>
<h2 id="haskellng-on-nix">HaskellNG on Nix</h2>
<p>When I first bumped into <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.distributions.nixos/15513">this post about the new way</a> to do Haskell with Nix, I thought : “Oh, this looks great but very bleeding edge and I’m down several rabbit holes already so let’s look at it later”. So I went my merry way installing following <a href="https://nixos.org/wiki/Haskell">the official Nix instructions on the wiki</a>. But then after installing the Haskell toolkit (apparently the <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/nix-dev@lists.science.uu.nl/msg13622.html">Nix crowd is too cool for the Haskell Platform</a>) I found out that the Nix tribe on OSX seemed to have already left the old ways behind and migrated to HaskellNG. I found out because I ran into this error:</p>
<pre><code>installing ‘haskell-hakyll-ghc7.8.4-4.6.1.1-shared’
error: Package ‘util-linux-2.26’ in ‘/../dev/nixpkgs/pkgs/os-specific/linux/util-linux/default.nix:54’ is not supported on ‘x86_64-darwin’, refusing to evaluate.</code></pre>
<p>Here are a few reasons why HaskellNG is the way to go, as summarised in the <a href="http://lists.science.uu.nl/pipermail/nix-dev/2015-January/015591.html">[Nix-dev] A Journey into the Haskell NG infrastructure: Part I</a> post:</p>
<ul>
<li>The NG package set contains the latest version of every package available from Hackage</li>
<li>Haskell NG supports GHC 7.10.x.</li>
<li>Haskell NG allows you to configure the hell out of your installation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-by-step">Step by step</h2>
<p>To recap, here’s what it took to set things up: - following <a href="https://nixos.org/wiki/Nix_on_OS_X#Using_Nix_on_10.9_and_10.10">these steps to install Nix on OSX 10.10</a> - adapting <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.distributions.nixos/15035/focus=15161">these steps</a> to haskellng - and <a href="http://wiki.ocharles.org.uk/Nix">this description of the haskell cabal workflow</a>.</p>
<h3 id="install-nix-on-osx">Install Nix on OSX</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://nixos.org/wiki/Nix_on_OS_X#Using_Nix_on_10.9_and_10.10">slightly more concise version of the official Nix wiki instructions</a>. ** I’d recommend heading over there for the latest!!! **</p>
<p>First, make sure to install Xcode or Command Line Tools (or both).</p>
<pre><code>$ curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
$ . $HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh
$ git clone https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git
$ nix-channel --remove nixpkgs
$ cd ~/.nix-defexpr
$ rm -rf *
$ ln -s /path/of/nixpkgs/clone nixpkgs</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ sudo mkdir /etc/nix</code></pre>
<p>Create a <code>/etc/nix/nix.conf</code> file with</p>
<pre><code>binary-caches = http://cache.nixos.org/ </code></pre>
<p>Update the .bashrc (change your USERNAME):</p>
<pre><code>export NIX_PATH=nixpkgs=/Users/USERNAME/dev/nixpkgs</code></pre>
<p>Source this</p>
<pre><code>$ source ~/.bashrc</code></pre>
<h2 id="configure-nix-for-haskell">Configure Nix for Haskell</h2>
<p>Create a ~/.nixpkgs directory and create a <code>~/.nixpkgs/config.nix</code> file which will be read each time you use nix</p>
<pre><code>{
  packageOverrides = super: let self = super.pkgs; in
  {
    haskellEnv = self.haskellngPackages.ghcWithPackages (p: with p; [
      cabal2nix
      cabal-install
    ]);
  };
}</code></pre>
<p>Install the haskellEnv with</p>
<pre><code>$ nix-env -iA nixpkgs.haskellEnv</code></pre>
<p>All of the other dependencies necessary for building your hakyll blog should be in the shell.nix generated by cabal2nix based on what is specified in the cabal file (where you would add/remove dependencies and rerun cabal2nix).</p>
<p>Go to the directory which contains the <code>.cabal</code> file of your haskell project and use <code>cabal2nix</code> to help create a <code>shell.nix</code> environment with the right dependencies.</p>
<pre><code>$ cabal2nix --shell . &gt; shell.nix</code></pre>
<p>When running this the first time I had an error about the nixpkgs directory and had to source ~/.bashrc with the proper $NIX_PATH variable.</p>
<pre><code>$ nix-shell --command &#39;cabal configure&#39;</code></pre>
<p>I got an error message about a nonfree license. Looking more into it, it’s my project that’s the culprit: the hakyll cabal package isn’t declaring a license. Wow, never got a build tool tell me that before. But I guess it makes a whole lot of sense, and it led me to <a href="https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/847#issuecomment-87065077">ponder about</a> what license a website generator should have, is it content or is it code?</p>
<p>I only spent a very short amount of time using cabal, and it seems that with the latest version and <code>cabal sandbox</code> things improved significantly. Cabal sandboxes allow several version of libraries to co-exist. But the time it took for spinning up a sandbox for a large project is quite long and in the worst case scenario, when dependencies reach into packages that are in the Haskell distribution (like cabal itself) then things start to be quite difficult. What Nix promises is that everything is separated by default, and when it’s safe to share packages (same hash of the whole dependency tree) then they won’t be rebuilt, meaning less compilation when its not needed! Nix still offers ways to control dependencies in a very granular way (what seems to be called deep overrides).</p>
<p>Time to cabal build:</p>
<pre><code>$ cabal build</code></pre>
<p>Note that this should be doable from the user environment (i.e. without the nix-shell command) except that it fails with this error:</p>
<pre><code>ghc-7.8.4/include/Stg.h:65:10:
     fatal error: &#39;math.h&#39; file not found
#include &lt;math.h&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Oops, seems like <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/6390">this thread</a> says that things don’t quite work the way it’s supposed to on OSX (because of the clang compiler). The option seems to be to rebuild everything with <code>export NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE=&quot;-idirafter /usr/include&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Instead I give a shot to running cabal (therefore ghc) from within the nix-shell and tada, it works:</p>
<pre><code>$ nix-shell --command &#39;cabal build&#39;
Building iilab-org-hakyll-0.1.0.0...
Preprocessing executable &#39;site&#39; for iilab-org-hakyll-0.1.0.0...
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( site.hs, dist/build/site/site-tmp/Main.o)
Linking dist/build/site/site ...</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-workflow">The workflow</h2>
<p>So here it is, I created a simple <code>rebuild.sh</code> script to rebuild the Hakyll binary and run it with the <code>clean</code> and <code>watch</code> arguments:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
set -e
nix-shell --command &#39;cabal build&#39;
./site clean
./site watch</code></pre>
<p>When needed I can also run the repl with</p>
<pre><code>$ nix-shell --command &#39;cabal repl&#39;</code></pre>
<p>If I add some Haskell imports and need to update the dependencies, I can do so in the cabal file and regenerate the shell.nix file with <code>cabal2nix --shell . &gt; shell.nix</code>.</p>
<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>The tooling for Haskell development seems to be evolving fast and progressively making things easier for juggling with dependencies. However the reality is that it is still far from being as simple as other development environments and takes quite a lot of work to setup properly. I also realise that I’m a bit worried about trying to set that up again on another machine if I have to. I do think that the benefits definitely outweigh the drawbacks, and that investing the time to set this up will result in peace of mind when wanting to try out the bleeding edge of Haskell without worrying about breaking other projects because of dependencies. The folks on IRC were very helpful, especially Henry Till (<code>henrytill</code> on IRC) who helped review this post and I recommend heading to the <code>##nix-darwin</code> IRC Channel on freenode if you run into problems.</p>
<p>I’ll share more about why Haskell and Functional Programming matter, as well as my experience with using Hakyll and migrating from metalsmith in a next post but the iilab site is now generated with Hakyll and the <a href="https://github.com/iilab/iilab.org-hakyll">source code is of course available on github</a>.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Open and Human Centric technology - Presenting Panic Button at Labtogether</title>
    <link>https://iilab.org/news/2014-11-06-betterplace-labtogether.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Betterplace Lab invited iilab to present our work with <a href="http://amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> on the <a href="https://panicbutton.io">Panic Button app</a> at the <a href="http://www.betterplace-lab.org/labtogether">Lab Together 2014</a>.</p>
<p>The main focus of my presentation was the role of the <strong>Open and Human Centered process</strong> that pervaded the project since it started in 2011.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Betterplace Lab is a research lab exploring digital innovations to help people, organizations and companies working in the social sector. At the Lab Together this year, they held a discussion on digital privacy with our friends <a href="https://www.tacticaltech.org/">Tactical Technology Collective</a> and the new Data and Politics project lead Fieke Jansen, panels on Crowdfinancing and Productive failure, and presentations on digital relief trends.</p>

</div>
<p>Panic Button didn’t come fully formed out of the <a href="https://openideo.com/challenge/amnesty/realisation/">Open Ideo open innovation process</a>, that it took a lot of iterations in prototyping and later in implementation to get to <a href="https://panicbutton.io">where the application is today</a>.</p>
<p>Also, Open Source is an useful approach to improve the sustainability of a social impact project. It allowed iilab to pick up where Toughtworks had left, and will allow other developers to get onboard in the future. A question from the audience correctly pointed out that there are other factors to be able to support the <a href="http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/howtobuildcommunity">emergence of an open source community around a project</a> and Panic Button is still in an incubation phase with a few <a href="https://github.com/iilab/PanicButton/graphs/contributors">contributors</a> including paid ones.</p>
<p>Crucially we used an <a href="https://github.com/iilab/PanicButton-Design">Open Design approach</a> which included the use of <a href="https://github.com/iilab/PanicButton-Design/tree/master/Archive/5_Prototype_v2/Prototype%20v2%20Paper%20wireframes">paper based prototypes</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/iilab/PanicButton-Design/tree/master/Usability%20Testing">structured method to collect the results</a> of user testing. We gathered security experts, also with a human centric and <a href="https://tacticaltech.org/holistic-security">holistic security</a> approach to evaluate risks and feed into the <a href="https://github.com/iilab/PanicButton/blob/master/docs/SECURITY.md">security design and documentation</a> of Panic Button.</p>
<p>I wish there would have been more time for interaction with the audience, but the feedback on twitter was good so I hope the presentation provided some food for thought.</p>

    <title>How to make a non-evil IoT - Open Droplet at LOTE4</title>
    <link>https://iilab.org/news/2014-11-02-open-droplet-lote4.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Last week we had the opportunity to take Open Droplet to LOTE4: The Stewardship. Open Droplet was one of the five projects looking at physical assets, and the only one that involved Internet of Things. IoT got a pretty bad vibe going from the get-go because of the associated scary privacy and control problems. (Alberto gave me a steer to <a href="http://kryakk-catalogue.prokhorovfund.ru/the-epic-struggle-for-the-internet-of-things/">Bruce Sterling’s “The Epic Struggle for the Internet of Things”</a> , which goes a good way to explaining the issues).</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For session notes, see the Open Droplet session here: <a href="https://lote4.hackpad.com/Stewarding-Physical-Assets-EVxm8c6PyiU"></a>https://lote4.hackpad.com/Stewarding-Physical-Assets-EVxm8c6PyiU</p>
<p>The session was interesting. We had an involved discussion about other aspects of the project, from the sensor design and usability, to how best to convey information to the user.</p>
<p>Some useful new suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>partner with hotels to raise awareness of this approach</li>
<li>consider representing the total household use</li>
</ul>
<p>There was reiteration of the importance of these considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>open data and privacy</li>
<li>comparison as a motivator</li>
<li>proper use by understanding the water infrastructure</li>
<li>facilitating conversation around community stewardship of water, including water harvesting</li>
</ul>
<p>However, we didn’t have that much time to discuss the IoT issues, which would have been great to explore with the EdgeRyders community. Internet of Things is happening, and could be very useful in terms of facilitating stewardship of physical assets. What we’re aiming for with Open Droplet is to create a device and system that helps connect people with water, an increasingly stressed resource, so that we can take better care of it as individuals and communities - and find new ways to do so. Part of how we want to do that is by following the principles of an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yZAsNaesDocqqtkFgucbFS_zE4tDP1Jsfszsvls7Yuc/edit">Open Internet of Things</a>.</p>
<p>I would love to extend the dialogue around these issues, and to have explored more the role of Internet of Things in creating social change, and looking at how sensing technologies can be tools to generate social and paradigmatic change. Due to timing issues the unconference session “<a href="https://lote4.hackpad.com/How-do-we-create-a-non-evil-IoT-X5pTvtOF8ma">How to make a non-evil IoT</a>” didn’t happen. We were going to look at building on work to make Open Hardware solutions that explicitly avoid making Big Data for the sake of it. How do you quantify without compromising people? I’d like to continue that discussion here and on the EdgeRyders platform, looking at these and other questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanding IoT - What data do we need to have from city and infrastructure providers to give useful context to individual water use?<br /></li>
<li>How do we responsibly approach the individual’s rights to their data</li>
<li>How do requirements for water stewardship vary around the globe? How do we accommodate these differences?</li>
<li>How do we facilitate community water stewardship through interface and sensor design?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="first-meeting-with-the-ucl-students">First meeting with the UCL Students</h2>
<p>Last month I had the pleasure to meet up in person with the students from Sarah Bell’s MSc Environmental Systems Engineering at UCL. Our team consists of Florian Abiteboul, Shanshan Tang, Cecilia Li, and Shibei Cheng and Anita Ponnathpore and it was a great first meeting. Having introduced the project, I’ve asked them to start off with the background research for a protocol to rapidly categorise cities in terms of their water infrastructure in order to see where Open Droplet’s approach might be most effective. When we meet this month, we’ll be handing over plans from the industrial research so that the students can then test calibration and flow detection in UCL’s toilets and showers.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Open Droplet features on Serpentine Gallery's extinct.ly platform</title>
    <link>https://iilab.org/news/2014-10-18-open-droplet-serpentine-extinctly.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>“the spectre of extinction looms over the ways in which we understand our being in the world today.”</p>
<p>At London’s Serpentine Gallery this weekend thinkers, scientists and artists are coming together to focus on this ever present spectre at the <a href="http://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/extinction-marathon">Extinction Marathon</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Understanding that it is only through collective action that we might avoid a disaster on a global scale, the gallery has commissioned <a href="http://extinct.ly">extinct.ly</a>, an online platform to act as a resource for researchers and those who wish to effect change.</p>
<p>We are honoured that Open Droplet has been picked to appear alongside other excellent projects such as <a href="http://hack4good.io/">hack4good</a> and our project partner <a href="https://iilab.org/projects/open-oil-framework.html">Open Oil</a> as the first projects to feature in extinct.ly’s launch.</p>
<p>On <a href="http://www.extinct.ly/casestudies/#open-droplet">Open Droplet’s page on extinct.ly</a> you can experience the near-future scenario that we have crafted around water scarcity.</p>

    <title>Deploying our Electronic Medical Records solution in DRC</title>
    <link>https://iilab.org/news/2014-10-11-drc-ltfhc.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>We recently came back from a field deployment in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We installed 6 Electronic Medical Record (EMR) solutions and another 5 radio sites.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The aim is to support health care workers in ultra rural settings to manage their medical records in a modern way and be able to report back to their distric hospital by transferring data over HF radio instead of the difficult travel needed currently.</p>

    <title>Open Droplet Experiments: Silicon Casing</title>
    <link>https://iilab.org/news/2014-09-22-open-droplet-enclosure.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>If you put some electronics in your bathroom, you want them to be waterproof.</p>
<p>We ran some tests last week on making Open Droplet shower safe, to stop water from getting in and playing havoc with the carefully constructed insides.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These first tests, shown in the video below, see us encasing Open Droplet in silicon, and investigating how the microphone responds to being encased and what effect it has on the LEDs.</p>
<div class="video-container post-media">

<p>
<a href="http://vimeo.com/106799877">Open Droplet for Smart and Stress Resilient Cities</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/iilab">iilab</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.
</p>
</div>
<p>Technical info: For this test we’re using low grade silicon (<a href="http://www.silikonfabrik.de/product_info.php?info=p134_HANSA-Silikon-HS620---0-9-kg.html">HS620 Silikon</a> + catalyst) with a blue pigment, and we measured proportions by weight. We coated the moulds with a wax separator (<a href="http://www.silikonfabrik.de/product_info.php?info=p14_Trennspray--500ml.html">Trennmittel</a>) so the silicon didn’t stick.</p>
<p>Next steps: * Modifying the gain of the microphone preamp to compensate for the silicon’s attenuation. * Including very low consumption LEDs on the PCB. * Add wax to make it easier to remove the silicon casing without damaging the sensor. * Test with higher grade silicon. * <a href="https://droplet.hackpad.com/Open-Droplet-Form-Design-km42HJk4XU1">Design the casing shape</a> for CNC milling of the mould. * Look into wireless charging. * Measure the heat generated by the power system.</p>]]></description>
